__DFreds Convenient Effects__ is a FoundryVTT module.

## Let Me Sell You This

## What This Module Doesn't Do

## My Philosophy

I've noticed over the months that a lot of FoundryVTT modules lack focus and good coding practice. A user should never be in a situation where they forget what any given module does. Additionally, a power user should never be totally lost on what's going on in a module if they dive into it.

In case anyone out there in the void is curious, this is my philosophy when it comes to implementing modules.

* Code should be easy to read, self-documenting, and contain JSDocs for any public functions
* Modules should do one thing, and one thing only. No "Quality of Life" catchalls from me. NO SIREE BOB.
* That thing the module does should do it well, with a minimum amount of initial configuration. It should "[Just Work](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ToddHoward2010sm_%28cropped%29.jpg)".
* Additional configuration should only be added if it really makes sense. If the configuration starts to change the thing the module does well, it shouldn't be there.
* Readmes (like this) should be funny AND informative. Please create a pull request if you think it could be funnier or informativer.
